## ü§ñ Description of the AI Logic

This application's intelligence is driven by the **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** model. The interaction with the AI is managed through carefully crafted prompts sent from the FastAPI backend.

1.  **Job Description Generation**: When the user opts to generate a JD, the backend collects the form inputs (job title, skills, etc.) and embeds them into a prompt that instructs Gemini to act as a senior recruiter and write a comprehensive job description.

2.  **Resume Evaluation**: This is the core AI task. For each resume, a detailed prompt is sent to the Gemini API. This prompt includes:
    *   The full text of the job description.
    *   The full text extracted from one candidate's resume.
    *   A strict instruction to return its analysis **only in a JSON format**. This JSON object must contain three specific keys: `score` (an integer), `missing_skills` (a list of strings), and `remarks` (a short string). This structured output is crucial for reliably parsing the data and displaying it on the frontend.

3.  **Email Generation**: After identifying the best-matched candidate, two types of prompts are sent:
    *   One prompt asks Gemini to write a warm, personalized interview invitation for the top candidate.
    *   Another prompt is used in a loop for the other candidates to generate a polite and respectful rejection email.

## üß† Explanation of Model Choice: Gemini 2.5 Flash

For this project, I chose **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model. This decision was based on a balance of performance, speed, and cost-efficiency, which are critical for a real-world web application.

*   **Speed and Low Latency**: "Flash" is specifically optimized for speed, making it ideal for interactive applications where users expect a fast response. When a user uploads resumes, they get the analysis back in seconds, not minutes.

*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: As a lightweight model, Gemini 2.5 Flash is significantly more affordable to run than larger models like Gemini 2.5 Pro or GPT-5. This makes it a practical choice for a tool that might process hundreds of resumes a day.

*   **Large Context Window**: Despite its speed, Gemini 2.5 Flash has a massive 1-million-token context window. This is a huge advantage for this specific task, as it can easily handle very long and detailed job descriptions and resumes without any risk of losing context or truncating information.

*   **Excellent Instruction Following**: The model has proven to be highly reliable at following specific instructions, such as returning its output in a clean, raw JSON format. This is vital for the stability of the application, as it prevents errors that could arise from parsing unstructured text.

In summary, Gemini 2.5 Flash provides the perfect blend of capabilities for this recruitment agent. It delivers the high-quality analysis needed for the task while ensuring the application remains fast, responsive, and economical to operate.
